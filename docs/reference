        type: REB;
        flags: [::VOLATILE];
        value: 1.0;
    }
}

// Implement recovery
if (aethel_level < 0.5) {
    recover: {
        type: standard;
        amount: 0.2;
    }
}
```

## Stability Management

### How do I maintain timeline stability?
```chronovyan
// Use proper anchoring
variables: {
    anchor: {
        type: CONF;
        flags: [::STATIC, ::ANCHOR];
        value: 0;
    }
}

// Monitor stability
monitor: {
    target: stability;
    threshold: 0.8;
}

// Stabilize when needed
if (stability < 0.8) {
    stabilize: {
        target: anchor;
        threshold: 0.9;
    }
}
```

### What causes timeline instability?
Common causes include:
- Insufficient anchoring
- Resource depletion
- Quantum interference
- Paradox formation

## Quantum Operations

### How do I create quantum states?
```chronovyan
variables: {
    quantum_state: {
        type: REB;
        flags: [::VOLATILE, ::WEAVER];
    }
}

quantum_ops: {
    superposition: {
        type: quantum;
        stability: low;
    }
}
```

### What's the difference between CONF and REB variables?
- CONF: High stability, resistant to quantum interference
- REB: More flexible, can change based on quantum conditions

### How do I handle quantum state collapse?
1. Monitor stability
2. Choose collapse strategy
3. Implement recovery
4. Verify results

## Paradox Management

        sensitivity: high;
    }
}
```

### What causes paradoxes?
Common causes:
- Timeline conflicts
- Quantum contradictions
- Stability breaches
- Resource conflicts

### How do I resolve paradoxes?
1. Detect early
2. Analyze cause
