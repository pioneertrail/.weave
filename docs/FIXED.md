# Fixed Issues in Chronovyan Interpreter Implementation

This document lists the specific issues that were fixed in the Chronovyan interpreter implementation.

## Build System Issues

1. **Missing Source Files in CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added `source_location.cpp` to the `SOURCES` list in CMakeLists.txt
   - This resolved linker errors related to `SourceLocation::toString` method

## Code Issues

1. **Header Include Issues**
   - Added missing `#include "error_handler.h"` in `parser.h` for `ChronovyanParseError` class
   - Added missing `#include "error_handler.h"` in `environment.cpp` for `ChronovyanRuntimeError` class
   - Added missing `#include <iostream>` in `interpreter.cpp` for `std::cout`

2. **Algorithm Issues**
   - Fixed `getLineAndColumn` method in `source_file.cpp` by changing `std::upper_bound` to `std::lower_bound`
   - This corrected the logic for finding the line that contains a specific position in the source text

3. **Temporal Runtime Implementation**
   - Updated `temporal_runtime.cpp` to match the interface defined in `temporal_runtime.h`
   - Implemented Timeline and TimePoint classes for managing temporal state
   - Added resource tracking for Aethel and Chronons

4. **Value Class Implementation**
   - Updated `toString()` method in `Value` class to provide better string representation
   - Fixed boolean representation to use lowercase "true" and "false"
   - Simplified map representation to avoid direct access to private members

5. **Native Function Handling**
   - Fixed ambiguity in the `Value` constructor for native functions by explicitly typing function parameters

## Features Added

1. **REPL Interface**
   - Implemented basic REPL functionality with commands:
     - `help`: Displays help information
     - `paradox`: Shows the current paradox level
     - `resources`: Displays current resource levels (Aethel and Chronons)
     - `exit`: Exits the REPL

2. **Resource Management**
   - Added tracking for Aethel and Chronon resources
   - Implemented methods for consuming and regenerating resources

3. **Temporal Operations**
   - Added foundations for temporal operations (not fully implemented yet)
   - Created structure for managing timelines and time points

## Parser Improvements

Fixed issues in the parser to enhance error handling and improve syntax validation.
The parser now properly handles nested expressions and validates variable declarations.

## Environment Handling

Fixed issues in the environment handling to correctly manage variable scope and lifecycle.
Temporal variables are now properly tracked across different scopes.

## Interpreter Optimization

Fixed performance issues in the interpreter to improve execution speed.
Reduced memory usage during interpretation of complex temporal operations.

## Source Handling

Fixed issues related to file loading and position tracking.
Line and column numbers are now accurately reported in error messages.

## Temporal Runtime

Fixed stability issues in the temporal runtime.
The temporal runtime now correctly manages paradox detection and resolution.
