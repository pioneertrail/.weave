# Technical Debt Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for addressing the technical debt items identified in the Chronovyan project.

## Prioritization Criteria

Technical debt items are prioritized based on:

1. **Impact on maintainability**: How much the debt affects our ability to maintain and extend the codebase
2. **Risk level**: Potential for introducing bugs or security issues
3. **Implementation cost**: Effort required to address the debt
4. **Business value**: How addressing the debt improves the product for users

## Implementation Timeline

### v1.2 Release (High Priority)

| ID | Description | Approach | Estimated Effort |
|----|-------------|----------|------------------|
| TD-1 | Complex error handling in StateController | Create a polymorphic error handling system with hierarchy of error types | 3 days |
| TD-2 | Duplicate recovery logic in ModeDecisionEngine | Extract a SensorRecoveryHandler class to centralize recovery logic | 2 days |

### v1.3 Release (Medium Priority)

| ID | Description | Approach | Estimated Effort |
|----|-------------|----------|------------------|
| TD-3 | Lack of centralized logging | Implement a LoggingService with configurable levels and outputs | 4 days |
| TD-4 | Test-specific handling in production code | Create TestSupportMixin classes for both ModeDecisionEngine and StateController | 3 days |

### v1.4 Release (Low Priority)

| ID | Description | Approach | Estimated Effort |
|----|-------------|----------|------------------|
| TD-5 | Magic numbers for thresholds | Create a ConfigurationService for managing thresholds and constants | 2 days |
| TD-6 | String-based reason codes | Replace strings with enum values and update all comparison logic | 3 days |

## Implementation Guidelines

For each technical debt item:

1. **Create a branch** named `tech-debt/TD-X-brief-description`
2. **Write tests** that validate the current behavior
3. **Refactor** the code while maintaining test coverage
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the changes
5. **Submit a PR** with before/after metrics

## Impact Assessment

After each technical debt resolution, we will measure:

1. **Code complexity metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity
2. **Test coverage**: Ensuring no regression in coverage
3. **Build times**: Impact on compilation speed
4. **Runtime performance**: Impact on key performance indicators

## Risk Mitigation

For high-risk changes:

1. **Implement incrementally** where possible
2. **Enable feature flags** to allow rollback if needed
3. **Conduct extra code reviews** with senior engineers
4. **Monitor closely** during the initial deployment

## Success Criteria

Technical debt resolution will be considered successful when:

1. The codebase shows **measurable improvement** in maintainability metrics
2. **Development velocity** increases for features that touch the refactored areas
3. **Bug count** decreases in the affected components
4. **Onboarding time** for new developers is reduced

## Reporting

Progress on technical debt resolution will be reported:

1. In **sprint reviews** as a dedicated section
2. In the **CHANGELOG.md** under "Technical Debt" section
3. In **quarterly engineering reports** with metrics
