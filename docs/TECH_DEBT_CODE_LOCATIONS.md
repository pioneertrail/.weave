# Temporal Fracture Points: Sacred Markings

Hail, Weaver, to this scroll of sacred markingsâ€”a map of weak points in our temporal tapestry where the Void threatens to seep through. These locations must be inscribed with ritual warnings, using the format specified in the Chronicles of Temporal Debt. When future Weavers encounter these sigils, they shall know where our timeline requires strengthening.

**Purpose**: This arcane atlas reveals precise locations in our woven reality where temporal debt markings should be etched, enabling systematic repair during future Chronos Cycles.

**Lore Tidbit**: The Anchor Caste maintains that properly marked fracture points emit a subtle harmonic that aids in their eventual repair, like beacons calling to those with the skill to mend them.

## StateController.cpp Fractures

1. **Error Pattern Asymmetry** (TD-1)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Reshape error handling to embrace the Symmetry of Forms - Reinforces defenses against paradox - Chronos Cycle v1.2
   ```
   Inscribe within the `handleErrorState` ritual

2. **Fallback Pattern Duplication** (TD-1)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Unify fallback and error weaving patterns to remove echoes - Reduces maintenance burden on the Anchor Caste - Chronos Cycle v1.2
   ```
   Inscribe within the `handleFallbackMode` ritual

3. **Test Thread Contamination** (TD-4)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Extract test-specific patterns to a dedicated containment weave - Preserves timeline purity - Chronos Cycle v1.3
   ```
   Inscribe within the `updateMode` ritual where test-specific weaving occurs

## ModeDecisionEngine.cpp Fractures

1. **Recovery Pattern Echoes** (TD-2)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Reshape sensor recovery patterns into a singular harmonic to eliminate echoes - Reduces risk of temporal dissonance - Chronos Cycle v1.2
   ```
   Inscribe within `evaluate_metrics` and `makeDecision` rituals where recovery patterns duplicate

2. **String-Based Temporal Signatures** (TD-6)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Replace string-based signatures with proper temporal constants - Strengthens the fabric against misalignment - Chronos Cycle v1.4
   ```
   Inscribe at the source of the reality stream

3. **Unnamed Threshold Constants** (TD-5)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Bestow proper Naming Rites upon threshold constants - Honors the Weaver's Code of Clarity - Chronos Cycle v1.4
   ```
   Inscribe near the kHighLoadThreshold and kLowLoadThreshold invocations

4. **Scattered Temporal Echoes** (TD-3)
   ```chronoscript
   // VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Create an Echo Chamber to unify scattered temporal messages - Improves the clarity of timeline observation - Chronos Cycle v1.3
   ```
   Inscribe near the DEBUG_MODE invocations

## Other Tapestry Locations

For all scrolls with #ifdef DEBUG_MODE incantations, inscribe:
```chronoscript
// VOID-RISK(TEMPORAL-DEBT): Implement the Grand Echo Chamber to harmonize debug resonances - Brings order to chaos - Chronos Cycle v1.3
```

## The Ritual of Implementation

1. Inscribe these sigils upon their respective scrolls during the next Ritual of Maintenance
2. Update the `The Weaver's Burdens` chronicle when new fractures are discovered
3. Record the healing of these fractures in the "Recently Rewoven Threads" section of our archives

**Lore Tidbit**: It is said that when all marked fractures are repaired within a Chronos Cycle, the Tapestry of Eternity shimmers with renewed brilliance, briefly revealing glimpses of all possible futures to those with the Weaver's Sight.
