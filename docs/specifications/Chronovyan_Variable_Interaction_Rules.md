# Chronovyan Variable Interaction Rules

## Introduction

This document specifies the rules governing interactions between variables in the Chronovyan language. It focuses particularly on how variables with different modifiers (CONF, REB) and flags (STATIC, FLUX, etc.) interact with each other and affect the PARADOX_LEVEL. These interaction rules are a critical component of Chronovyan's temporal mechanics and must be followed by all conforming implementations.

## Core Principles

The interaction between variables in Chronovyan is governed by five core principles:

1. **Duality Balance**: The balance between Order (CONF) and Flux (REB) is maintained through carefully designed interaction penalties and benefits.

2. **Conservation of Stability**: Stability cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between different parts of the system.

3. **Temporal Influence**: All variable interactions have ripple effects through the program's timeline.

4. **Locality Matters**: Interactions between variables in the same scope have different effects than cross-scope interactions.

5. **Paradox Accumulation**: Small instabilities accumulate over time and can cascade into larger paradoxes if not managed.

## Variable Modifier Interactions

### CONF × CONF Interactions

When two CONF variables interact (through assignment, comparison, arithmetic, etc.), the following rules apply:

1. **Stability Reinforcement**: Each interaction between CONF variables reduces the ambient PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.001 (cumulative, but capped at -0.01 per operation).

2. **Type Conformity**: Interactions maintain type integrity; no implicit type conversions are permitted unless explicitly defined in the type system.

3. **Predictable Outcome**: The result of CONF × CONF operations is always deterministic and repeatable.

4. **Chronon Efficiency**: Operations between CONF variables consume fewer Chronons than other interaction types.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::STATIC base_value : INT = 100;
DECLARE CONF::STATIC modifier : INT = 5;
DECLARE CONF::STATIC result : INT = base_value + modifier; // Reduces PARADOX_LEVEL slightly
```

### REB × REB Interactions

When two REB variables interact, the following rules apply:

1. **Quantum Entanglement**: Each interaction between REB variables increases the ambient PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.003 (cumulative, but capped at +0.03 per operation).

2. **Probabilistic Outcomes**: Results may have quantum uncertainty, represented as probability distributions over possible values.

3. **Type Fluidity**: Implicit type conversions may occur spontaneously, with probability increasing with PARADOX_LEVEL.

4. **Chronon Consumption**: Operations between REB variables consume more Chronons than other interaction types.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE REB::FLUX quantum_value : INT = 10;
DECLARE REB::FLUX uncertainty : FLOAT = 0.3;
DECLARE REB::FLUX output : QUANTUM_STATE = quantum_value * uncertainty; // Increases PARADOX_LEVEL
```

### CONF × REB Interactions

When CONF and REB variables interact, the following rules apply:

1. **Stabilization Attempt**: The system attempts to stabilize the REB variable through the interaction, reducing its quantum fluctuations.

2. **Paradox Neutrality**: PARADOX_LEVEL is generally unaffected (±0.000) by balanced CONF × REB interactions.

3. **Dominance Resolution**: Either the CONF nature or the REB nature must dominate in the result:
   - If assigned to a CONF variable: REB properties are stripped with a PARADOX_LEVEL cost of +0.005 per conversion
   - If assigned to a REB variable: CONF properties are maintained until the next REB operation

4. **Chronon Moderation**: Operations consume a moderate amount of Chronons.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::STATIC anchor : INT = 50;
DECLARE REB::FLUX quantum_value : INT = 10;

// CONF dominating outcome
DECLARE CONF result1 : INT = anchor + quantum_value; // Costs +0.005 PARADOX_LEVEL

// REB dominating outcome
DECLARE REB result2 : INT = anchor + quantum_value; // No immediate PARADOX_LEVEL change
```

## Variable Flag Interactions

### STATIC Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::STATIC flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Immutability Enforcement**: Any attempt to modify a ::STATIC variable after initialization raises an error and increases PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.1.

2. **Reference Stability**: Using ::STATIC variables as reference points decreases operation PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.005.

3. **Cross-Timeline Consistency**: ::STATIC variables maintain their values across timeline branches and REWIND operations.

4. **Resource Generation**: ::STATIC variables slowly generate Aethel over time (0.01 units per program cycle).

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::STATIC constants : MAP<STRING, FLOAT> = {
    "pi": 3.14159,
    "e": 2.71828,
    "golden_ratio": 1.61803
};

// Legal: Reading a ::STATIC variable
DECLARE CONF pi_value : FLOAT = constants["pi"];

// Illegal: Attempting to modify a ::STATIC variable
// constants["new_value"] = 1.0; // Error: Cannot modify ::STATIC variable
```

### FLUX Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::FLUX flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Quantum Fluctuation**: ::FLUX variables spontaneously change values with probability proportional to PARADOX_LEVEL.

2. **Instability Propagation**: When a ::FLUX variable is used in an operation, it increases the operation's PARADOX_LEVEL contribution by 0.002.

3. **Cross-Timeline Divergence**: ::FLUX variables may have different values in different timeline branches.

4. **Resource Consumption**: ::FLUX variables consume Aethel over time (0.02 units per program cycle).

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE REB::FLUX uncertainty : FLOAT = 0.1;

// The value of uncertainty may change spontaneously
FOR_CHRONON(10) {
    print(uncertainty); // May show different values on each iteration
}

// Operations using ::FLUX variables have increased PARADOX_LEVEL impact
DECLARE CONF result : FLOAT = some_value * uncertainty; // Higher PARADOX_LEVEL contribution
```

### ANCHOR Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::ANCHOR flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Temporal Stability**: ::ANCHOR variables create fixed points in the timeline that resist temporal changes.

2. **Paradox Resistance**: Operations involving ::ANCHOR variables reduce PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.01.

3. **REWIND Protection**: ::ANCHOR variables retain their values during REWIND operations unless explicitly included in the rewind scope.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: Operations on ::ANCHOR variables consume 50% fewer Chronons.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::ANCHOR checkpoint : TIMESTAMP = mark_timestamp("Critical Point");

// Using the ANCHOR for a REWIND operation
REWIND_TO(checkpoint, [
    // Operations to rewind
]);

// Operations using ::ANCHOR variables have reduced PARADOX_LEVEL impact
IF (current_time() > checkpoint) {
    // This conditional has reduced PARADOX_LEVEL contribution
}
```

### WEAVER Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::WEAVER flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Timeline Manipulation**: ::WEAVER variables can influence and modify the program's timeline structure.

2. **Paradox Potential**: Operations involving ::WEAVER variables increase PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.02.

3. **Cross-Timeline Influence**: ::WEAVER variables can affect multiple timelines simultaneously.

4. **Resource Intensity**: Operations on ::WEAVER variables consume 100% more Chronons and Aethel.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE REB::WEAVER timeline_modifier : TEMPORAL_SIGNATURE = generate_signature("Modifier");

// Using the WEAVER to manipulate timelines
BRANCH_TIMELINE(timeline_modifier, [
    // Operations in the new branch
]);

// Operations using ::WEAVER variables have increased PARADOX_LEVEL impact
MERGE_TIMELINES(main_timeline, timeline_modifier); // Significant PARADOX_LEVEL increase
```

### ECHO Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::ECHO flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Value Reverberation**: ::ECHO variables retain "echoes" of their previous values, accessible through special operations.

2. **Temporal History**: Each value change is recorded in the variable's history, consumable through ECHO_TRACE operations.

3. **Paradox Sensitivity**: ::ECHO variables are more sensitive to PARADOX_LEVEL changes (±0.005 per operation).

4. **Resource Scaling**: Resource consumption scales with the length of the echo history.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::ECHO counter : INT = 0;

// Modifying an ::ECHO variable records its history
FOR_CHRONON(5) {
    counter += 1;
}

// Accessing the echo history
ECHO_TRACE(counter, 3); // Returns the 3 most recent values: [5, 4, 3]
```

### SOURCE_INFUSED Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::SOURCE_INFUSED flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Origin Connection**: ::SOURCE_INFUSED variables maintain a connection to the Source (the core of the program's reality).

2. **Paradox Reduction**: Operations involving ::SOURCE_INFUSED variables reduce PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.02.

3. **Timeline Anchoring**: ::SOURCE_INFUSED variables help anchor the program's main timeline against fracturing.

4. **Resource Generation**: ::SOURCE_INFUSED variables generate both Chronons and Aethel (0.01 units per program cycle).

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::SOURCE_INFUSED reality_anchor : STABILITY_MATRIX = initialize_matrix();

// Using SOURCE_INFUSED variables stabilizes operations
stabilize_timeline(reality_anchor, 100); // Enhanced stabilization effect

// Operations using ::SOURCE_INFUSED variables have reduced PARADOX_LEVEL impact
IF (PARADOX_LEVEL > 0.5) {
    infuse_stability(reality_anchor, critical_section);
}
```

### VOLATILE Flag Interactions

Variables with the ::VOLATILE flag follow these interaction rules:

1. **Temporary Existence**: ::VOLATILE variables may be garbage-collected when resources are scarce.

2. **Paradox Insensitivity**: ::VOLATILE variables neither contribute to nor are affected by PARADOX_LEVEL changes.

3. **Timeline Independence**: ::VOLATILE variables exist outside the main temporal system.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: ::VOLATILE variables consume minimal resources but provide no stability benefits.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::VOLATILE temp_result : INT = expensive_calculation();

// Using the result before it might be reclaimed
process_result(temp_result);

// VOLATILE variables don't affect PARADOX_LEVEL
FOR_CHRONON(1000) {
    DECLARE CONF::VOLATILE loop_temp : INT = i * 2;
    // No PARADOX_LEVEL accumulation despite many variable creations
}
```

## Variable Interaction Effects on PARADOX_LEVEL

The following table summarizes how different variable interactions affect the PARADOX_LEVEL:

| Interaction Type | PARADOX_LEVEL Change | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| CONF × CONF | -0.001 | Capped at -0.01 per operation |
| REB × REB | +0.003 | Capped at +0.03 per operation |
| CONF × REB | ±0.000 | Neutral unless conversion occurs |
| CONF conversion from REB | +0.005 | Per conversion |
| REB conversion from CONF | +0.000 | No immediate effect |
| ::STATIC read | -0.005 | Reference stability bonus |
| ::STATIC modification attempt | +0.1 | Error condition |
| ::FLUX operation | +0.002 | Additional instability |
| ::ANCHOR operation | -0.01 | Stability bonus |
| ::WEAVER operation | +0.02 | Timeline manipulation cost |
| ::ECHO operation | ±0.005 | Depends on history length |
| ::SOURCE_INFUSED operation | -0.02 | Source connection bonus |
| ::VOLATILE operation | ±0.000 | No effect on PARADOX_LEVEL |

## Scope-Based Interaction Rules

### Same-Scope Interactions

When variables interact within the same scope (function, block, or pattern), the following rules apply:

1. **Enhanced Efficiency**: Resource consumption is reduced by 20%.
2. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**: Effects on PARADOX_LEVEL are amplified by 1.2×.
3. **Type Compatibility**: Implicit conversions are more likely to succeed.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
{
    // Same-scope interactions
    DECLARE CONF value1 : INT = 10;
    DECLARE CONF value2 : INT = 20;
    DECLARE CONF result : INT = value1 + value2; // Enhanced efficiency, amplified PARADOX_LEVEL reduction
}
```

### Cross-Scope Interactions

When variables interact across different scopes, the following rules apply:

1. **Reduced Efficiency**: Resource consumption is increased by 30%.
2. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**: Effects on PARADOX_LEVEL are reduced by 0.8×.
3. **Type Compatibility**: Implicit conversions are less likely to succeed.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF global_value : INT = 100;

define_pattern("Process", [
    // Cross-scope interaction
    DECLARE CONF local_result : INT = global_value * 2; // Reduced efficiency, diminished PARADOX_LEVEL reduction
]);
```

### Temporal Scope Interactions

When variables interact across different temporal scopes (e.g., before/after REWIND), the following rules apply:

1. **Temporal Cost**: Additional Chronon cost of 5 units per operation.
2. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**: Effects on PARADOX_LEVEL are amplified by 1.5×.
3. **Type Compatibility**: Implicit conversions require explicit temporal adapters.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF original_value : INT = 50;

REWIND_FLOW(10, [
    DECLARE CONF changed_value : INT = 75;
]);

// Temporal scope interaction
DECLARE CONF final_result : INT = original_value + changed_value; // High temporal cost, significant PARADOX_LEVEL impact
```

## Variable Lifetime Interaction Rules

### Creation and Destruction

The creation and destruction of variables follow these rules:

1. **Initialization Cost**: Variable creation consumes Chronons proportional to variable size.
2. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**:
   - CONF variable creation: -0.001 PARADOX_LEVEL
   - REB variable creation: +0.002 PARADOX_LEVEL
3. **Destruction Effects**:
   - CONF variable destruction: No PARADOX_LEVEL effect
   - REB variable destruction: -0.001 PARADOX_LEVEL (instability resolution)

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Variable creation impacts
{
    DECLARE CONF temp1 : INT = 0; // Slight PARADOX_LEVEL reduction
    DECLARE REB temp2 : INT = 0; // Slight PARADOX_LEVEL increase
    
    // When scope ends, temp2 destruction slightly reduces PARADOX_LEVEL
}
```

### Lifetime Extension

When a variable's lifetime is extended beyond its normal scope, these rules apply:

1. **Extended Resource Cost**: 5% additional Chronon cost per program cycle.
2. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**: +0.001 per program cycle for REB variables, no change for CONF variables.
3. **Temporal Strain**: Contributes to timeline instability if many variables have extended lifetimes.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF::ECHO extended_result : INT = 0;

EXTEND_LIFETIME(extended_result, GLOBAL, [
    // Operations that use extended_result beyond its normal scope
]);
```

## Cross-Type Interaction Rules

### Primitive × Complex Type Interactions

When primitive types interact with complex types, the following rules apply:

1. **Composition Cost**: Creating complex types from primitives costs 0.001 PARADOX_LEVEL per element.
2. **Extraction Benefit**: Extracting primitives from complex types reduces PARADOX_LEVEL by 0.0005 per extraction.
3. **Type Dominance**: The complex type's CONF/REB nature dominates in determining interaction effects.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF base_value : INT = 10;
DECLARE REB::FLUX values : ARRAY<INT> = [];

// Composition: Primitive → Complex
values.add(base_value); // Costs 0.001 PARADOX_LEVEL

// Extraction: Complex → Primitive
DECLARE CONF extracted : INT = values[0]; // Benefits -0.0005 PARADOX_LEVEL
```

### Temporal × Non-Temporal Type Interactions

When temporal types interact with non-temporal types, the following rules apply:

1. **Temporal Infusion**: Non-temporal values become time-aware when interacting with temporal types.
2. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**: +0.005 for infusing temporal properties, -0.003 for extracting standard values.
3. **Resource Requirements**: Temporal infusion requires at least 5 Chronons and 2 Aethel units.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
DECLARE CONF standard_value : INT = 42;
DECLARE CONF::ANCHOR temporal_point : TIMESTAMP = mark_timestamp("Now");

// Temporal infusion
DECLARE CONF time_bound_value : TEMPORAL<INT> = bind_to_time(standard_value, temporal_point); // +0.005 PARADOX_LEVEL

// Temporal extraction
DECLARE CONF extracted_value : INT = extract_value(time_bound_value); // -0.003 PARADOX_LEVEL
```

## Pattern-Based Variable Interactions

### Conformist Patterns

When variables are used within Conformist Patterns, the following rules apply:

1. **Stability Amplification**: PARADOX_LEVEL reductions are amplified by 1.5×.
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Chronon consumption reduced by 30%.
3. **Type Enforcement**: Strict type checking with no implicit conversions.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
CONFORMIST_PATTERN("StableOperation", [
    DECLARE CONF value1 : INT = 10;
    DECLARE CONF value2 : INT = 20;
    DECLARE CONF result : INT = value1 + value2; // Enhanced stability, efficient execution
]);
```

### Rebellious Patterns

When variables are used within Rebellious Patterns, the following rules apply:

1. **Quantum Enhancement**: Quantum operations have 50% greater effect.
2. **Resource Intensity**: Chronon consumption increased by 40%.
3. **Type Fluidity**: Liberal type handling with automatic conversions.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
REBELLIOUS_PATTERN("QuantumFluctuation", [
    DECLARE REB::FLUX q1 : QUANTUM_STATE = initialize_superposition([{value: 0, probability: 0.5}, {value: 1, probability: 0.5}]);
    DECLARE REB::FLUX q2 : QUANTUM_STATE = initialize_superposition([{value: 0, probability: 0.3}, {value: 1, probability: 0.7}]);
    DECLARE REB::FLUX entangled : QUANTUM_STATE = entangle(q1, q2); // Enhanced quantum operations
]);
```

## Variable Interaction and Error Handling

### Error Propagation

When errors occur during variable interactions, the following rules apply:

1. **PARADOX_LEVEL Impact**: +0.01 per unhandled error, +0.001 per handled error.
2. **Error Containment**: CONF variables limit error propagation, REB variables may amplify it.
3. **Resource Drain**: Errors consume 5 Chronons and 2 Aethel units per occurrence.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
TRY {
    DECLARE CONF result : INT = divide(10, 0); // Error occurs
} CATCH(error) {
    // Handled error: +0.001 PARADOX_LEVEL
    log_error(error);
}

// Versus:
// DECLARE CONF result : INT = divide(10, 0); // Unhandled error: +0.01 PARADOX_LEVEL
```

### Stability Recovery

After high PARADOX_LEVEL events, variables follow these recovery rules:

1. **CONF Variable Recovery**: Automatic recovery to stable state, costs 2 Chronons per variable.
2. **REB Variable Recovery**: Requires explicit stabilization, costs 5 Chronons per variable.
3. **Recovery Rate**: PARADOX_LEVEL decreases by 0.05 per program cycle during recovery.

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// After a high PARADOX_LEVEL event
STABILIZE_CONTEXT(current_scope, 10); // Allocates 10 Chronons to recovery

// Explicit REB variable stabilization
stabilize_variable(unstable_quantum_value);
```

## Implementation Requirements

All compliant Chronovyan implementations must:

1. Track PARADOX_LEVEL changes based on variable interactions as specified in this document.
2. Enforce the different behaviors for different variable modifiers and flags.
3. Implement the resource consumption model for Chronons and Aethel.
4. Properly handle scope-based and lifetime-based interaction rules.
5. Support the error handling and recovery mechanisms.

The interaction rules defined in this document are essential to preserving the balance between Order and Flux in Chronovyan programs and ensuring consistent behavior across different implementations.

## Appendix: Stability Optimization Techniques

The following techniques can be used to optimize variable interactions for stability:

1. **Strategic CONF/REB Balancing**: Maintain a ratio of approximately 2:1 CONF to REB variables for optimal stability.
2. **Flag Complementarity**: Pair ::FLUX variables with ::ANCHOR variables in the same scope to neutralize instability.
3. **Scope Containment**: Contain REB variables in narrow scopes to limit their temporal impact.
4. **Strategic ::STATIC Placement**: Use ::STATIC variables at critical decision points to reduce PARADOX_LEVEL spikes.
5. **::SOURCE_INFUSED Strategic Usage**: Place ::SOURCE_INFUSED variables in high-instability regions of code.

These techniques can help developers write more stable Chronovyan programs while still leveraging the power of quantum and temporal operations.
