# Getting Started: The Path to Temporal Mastery

## Introduction
Welcome to Chronovyan, a revolutionary programming language that embraces the concept of temporal programming. This guide will help you begin your journey into the world of temporal computation.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with control flow and variables
- Understanding of resource management
- A sense of temporal awareness (don't worry, we'll develop this!)

## Installation
1. Download the Chronovyan compiler from [official repository]
2. Install the Temporal Development Kit (TDK)
3. Configure your development environment
4. Verify installation with the Hello World example

## Core Concepts

### 1. Temporal Programming Basics
- **Timeline**: The fundamental unit of execution
- **Chronon**: The basic unit of temporal measurement
- **Aethel**: The energy resource for temporal operations
- **Stability**: The measure of temporal coherence

### 2. Your First Program
```chronovyan
temporal_program {
    name: "First Steps";
    type: standard;
    resources: {
        aethel: 5;
        chronon: 3;
    }
    
    variables: {
        message: {
            type: CONF;
            flags: [::STATIC];
            value: "Welcome to Chronovyan!";
        }
    }
    
    execution: {
        FOR_CHRONON {
            iterations: 1;
            body: {
                output: message;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
