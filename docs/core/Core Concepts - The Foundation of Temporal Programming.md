# Core Concepts: The Foundation of Temporal Programming

## Introduction to Chronovyan

Chronovyan is a temporal programming language designed for manipulating timelines and managing quantum states. It provides a structured way to handle temporal operations while maintaining stability and preventing paradoxes.

### Key Features
- Temporal manipulation
- Quantum state management
- Stability control
- Paradox prevention
- Resource optimization

## Basic Structure

### Program Structure
```chronovyan
temporal_program {
    name: "example";
    type: standard;
    resources: {
        aethel: 10;
        chronon: 5;
    }
    
    variables: {
        counter: {
            type: CONF;
            flags: [::STATIC];
            value: 0;
        }
    }
    
    execution: {
        // Program logic here
    }
}
```

### Resource Management
- Aethel: Energy for quantum operations
- Chronon: Time manipulation units
- Stability: Timeline coherence measure
- Paradox Risk: Timeline conflict measure

## Variable Types

### CONF (Constant)
- High stability
- Resistant to quantum interference
- Used for anchors and constants
- Cannot be modified by quantum operations

### REB (Rebellious)
- Variable stability
- Can be modified by quantum operations
- Used for quantum states
- Requires careful management

## Variable Flags

### ::STATIC
- Constant value
- Cannot be modified
- High stability
- Used for anchors

### ::VOLATILE
- Can change
- Quantum-sensitive
- Requires monitoring
- Used for quantum states

### ::ANCHOR
- Stability anchor
- Timeline reference point
- High stability
- Used for timeline control

### ::WEAVER
- Quantum operations
- Timeline manipulation
- Variable stability
- Used for quantum states

## Basic Operations

### Timeline Operations
```chronovyan
timeline_ops: {
    branch: {
        type: standard;
        stability: medium;
    }
    
    merge: {
        type: standard;
        stability: high;
    }
}
```

### Quantum Operations
```chronovyan
quantum_ops: {
    superposition: {
        type: quantum;
        stability: low;
    }
    
    collapse: {
        type: quantum;
        strategy: optimal;
    }
}
```

### Stability Management
```chronovyan
monitor: {
    target: stability;
    threshold: 0.8;
}

if (stability < 0.8) {
    stabilize: {
        target: anchor;
        threshold: 0.9;
    }
}
```

## Control Structures

### Conditional Operations
```chronovyan
if (condition) {
    // Operations
} else {
    // Alternative operations
}
```

### Temporal Loops
```chronovyan
FOR_CHRONON {
    iterations: 5;
    body: {
        // Loop operations
    }
}
```

### Quantum Loops
```chronovyan
FOR_QUANTUM {
    states: 3;
    body: {
        // Quantum operations
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Resource Monitoring
```chronovyan
monitor: {
    target: resources;
    threshold: 0.5;
}
```

### Stability Recovery
```chronovyan
if (stability < threshold) {
    recover: {
        type: standard;
        target: anchor;
    }
}
```

### Paradox Prevention
```chronovyan
paradox_ops: {
    detect: {
        type: continuous;
        sensitivity: high;
    }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Timeline Branching
```chronovyan
timeline_ops: {
    branch: {
        type: standard;
        stability: medium;
    }
    
    process: {
        type: standard;
        body: {
            // Branch operations
        }
    }
    
    merge: {
        type: standard;
        stability: high;
    }
}
```

### Quantum State Management
```chronovyan
quantum_ops: {
    create: {
        type: quantum;
        stability: low;
    }
    
    process: {
        type: quantum;
        body: {
            // State operations
        }
    }
    
    collapse: {
        type: quantum;
        strategy: optimal;
    }
}
```

### Stability Management
```chronovyan
monitor: {
    target: stability;
    threshold: 0.8;
}

if (stability < 0.8) {
    stabilize: {
        target: anchor;
        threshold: 0.9;
    }
}
```
