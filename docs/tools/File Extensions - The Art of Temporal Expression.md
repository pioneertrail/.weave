# File Extensions: The Art of Temporal Expression in Chronovyan

In Chronovyan, even the humble file extension becomes a statement of philosophy, a declaration of intent in the eternal dance between Order and Flux. Let us explore the rich tapestry of file types that make up the Chronovyan ecosystem.

## I. Core Source Files

### The Primary Weave
```chronovyan
// The definitive Chronovyan source file
program.weave {
    type: SOURCE,
    philosophy: {
        conf_ratio: 60%,
        reb_ratio: 40%
    },
    metadata: {
        author: "The Weaver",
        timeline: "Current"
    }
}
```

The `.weave` extension represents the raw fabric of Chronovyan code, the primary canvas upon which Weavers express their temporal vision. It is the most common extension for source files, embodying the language's core philosophy of duality.

## II. Compiled Artifacts

### Conformist Output
```chronovyan
// The anchored, stable executable
program.anchor {
    type: COMPILED,
    stability: ABSOLUTE,
    characteristics: {
        temporal_laws: ENFORCED,
        causality: STRICT,
        entropy: CONTROLLED
    }
}
```

The `.anchor` extension denotes compiled programs that embrace the Conformist path, producing stable, predictable executables that adhere strictly to temporal laws.

### Rebel Output
```chronovyan
// The flux state executable
program.flux {
    type: COMPILED,
    stability: DYNAMIC,
    characteristics: {
        temporal_laws: ADAPTIVE,
        causality: FLEXIBLE,
        entropy: MANAGED
    }
}
```

The `.flux` extension represents compiled programs that follow the Rebel path, producing dynamic executables that can adapt to changing temporal conditions.

## III. Temporal Artifacts

### Loot Definitions
```chronovyan
// Temporal shard definition
temporal_shard.shard {
    type: LOOT,
    properties: {
        power: TEMPORAL,
        stability: VARIABLE,
        infusion_cost: CALCULATED
    }
}

// Weaver schematic
weaver_schematic.infuse {
    type: LOOT,
    properties: {
        power: WEAVER,
        stability: FLUX,
        infusion_cost: DYNAMIC
    }
}
```

The `.shard` and `.infuse` extensions define the loot that can be discovered and infused into variables, each carrying its own temporal properties and costs.

### Temporal Manifests
```chronovyan
// Program timeline definition
program_flow.tflow {
    type: MANIFEST,
    properties: {
        temporal_interactions: DEFINED,
        stability_requirements: SPECIFIED,
        resource_allocations: MAPPED
    }
}
```

The `.tflow` extension describes a program's intended interaction with time, mapping out its temporal journey and resource requirements.

## IV. Best Practices

### For Conformist Development

1. **File Organization**
    * Use `.weave` for source files
    * Target `.anchor` for compilation
    * Document with `.tflow` manifests

2. **Resource Management**
    * Define stable loot in `.shard`
    * Map temporal flows in `.tflow`
    * Track stability in `.anchor`

3. **Development Strategy**
    * Maintain clear file types
    * Document temporal laws
    * Track stability metrics

### For Rebel Development

1. **File Organization**
    * Use `.weave` for source files
    * Target `.flux` for compilation
    * Document with `.tflow` manifests

2. **Resource Management**
    * Define dynamic loot in `.infuse`
    * Map temporal flows in `.tflow`
    * Track flux states in `.flux`

3. **Development Strategy**
    * Embrace file diversity
    * Document temporal risks
    * Track flux metrics

### For All Developers

1. **File Mastery**
    * Understand file types
    * Choose appropriate extensions
    * Document your choices

2. **Resource Awareness**
    * Track file relationships
    * Balance stability and flux
    * Document temporal flows

3. **Development Evolution**
    * Plan for growth
    * Learn from experience
    * Document your journey

Remember: In Chronovyan, your file extensions are not just identifiers â€“ they are declarations of philosophy, your choice between Order and Flux. Choose your extensions wisely, and let them guide your journey in the eternal dance of creation.
