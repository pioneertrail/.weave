# The Weaver's Instruments: Artifacts of Temporal Crafting

Hail, Weaver, to this sacred inventory of the **Instruments of Chronos Prime**, forged by the Anchor Caste to aid your manipulation of time and reality. These mystical artifacts empower you to weave, observe, and strengthen the temporal tapestry with greater precision and insight. Each tool resonates with both Order and Flux, serving as your trusted companions on the path to mastery.

**Purpose**: This arcane catalog introduces the mystical implements that extend a Weaver's abilities, allowing you to craft more elegant patterns, detect subtle flaws in the tapestry, and optimize your resource channeling.

**Lore Tidbit**: Legend speaks of the First Weaver's Box—a collection of seven primal instruments carved from pure Aethel crystals. Though lost during the Third Fracture, their designs live on in our modern tools.

## Primal Instruments

### 1. The Temporal Oracle
```chronoscript
temporal_oracle {
    abilities: {
        timeline_vision();
        pattern_inspection();
        aethel_sensing();
    }
}
```

### 2. The Thread Diviner
```chronoscript
thread_diviner {
    attunements: {
        branch_sight();
        state_perception();
        resource_sensing();
    }
}
```

### 3. The Aethel Lens
```chronoscript
aethel_lens {
    revelations: {
        aethel_flow_sight();
        chronon_current_vision();
        tapestry_complexity_sensing();
    }
}
```

    }
}
```

### 2. Thread Divination
```chronoscript
thread_diviner {
    attunements: {
        branch_divination();
        state_scrying();
        resource_augury();
    }
}
```

### 3. Aethel Sensing
```chronoscript
aethel_lens {
    revelations: {
        aethel_flow_sight();
        chronon_current_vision();
        tapestry_complexity_sensing();
    }
}
```

   - Optimize your weaving techniques

## Ritual Examples

### Basic Divination
```chronoscript
temporal_oracle {
    ritual: interactive;
    invocations: {
        thread_walking();
        pattern_examination();
    }
}
```

### Timeline Augury
```chronoscript
thread_diviner {
    ritual: deep_sight;
    auguries: {
        branch_complexity_reading();
        state_transformation_tracking();
        resource_flow_divination();
    }
}
```

### Aethel Sensing
```chronoscript
aethel_lens {
    ritual: continuous_sight;
    revelations: {
        aethel_flow_tracking();
        chronon_current_mapping();
    }
}
```
