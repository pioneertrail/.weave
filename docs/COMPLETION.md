# File Extension Migration Completion Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the Chronovyan language file extensions from the original `.chronovyan` format to the new `.cvy` format and related extensions.

## Completed Changes

### Documentation Updates

1. ‚úÖ Updated `core/File Extensions - The Art of Temporal Expression.md`
   - Changed `.chron` to `.cvy`
   - Changed `.tchron` to `.tcvy`
   - Changed `.qchron` to `.qcvy`
   - Updated related configuration and documentation extensions

2. ‚úÖ Updated `tools/File Extensions - The Art of Temporal Expression.md`
   - Changed `.weave` to `.cvy`
   - Changed `.anchor` to `.ancvy`
   - Changed `.flux` to `.flxcvy`
   - Changed `.shard` to `.shdcvy`
   - Changed `.infuse` to `.infcvy`
   - Changed `.tflow` to `.tcvy`

3. ‚úÖ Created `CVY_File_Format.md`
   - New reference document for the `.cvy` file format
   - Includes syntax, structure, and best practices

4. ‚úÖ Updated `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Added entry documenting the file extension change

### Code Updates

5. ‚úÖ Updated `src/main.cpp`
   - Added file extension validation for `.cvy` files
   - Updated help messages to reference `.cvy` files
   - Added warning for files without the `.cvy` extension

### New Content

6. ‚úÖ Created example files in the `examples/` directory
   - Added `hello_world.cvy` as a basic example
   - Added `temporal_branching.cvy` as an advanced example
   - Created `README.md` explaining the examples

### Cross-Reference Fixes

7. ‚úÖ Created/improved documentation validation tools
   - Created `scripts/check_cross_references.py` to detect broken references
   - Created `scripts/update_references.py` to automatically update extensions
   - Fixed broken references in documentation files:
     - Updated `docs/core/Phase1_Completion_Summary.md`
     - Updated `docs/phase_summaries/Phase_2_Completion_Summary.md`
     - Fixed path references in various documentation files

## Future Considerations

1. üìù Consider creating syntax highlighting definitions for common editors (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
2. üìù Update any testing frameworks to use the new file extensions
3. üìù Consider creating migration tools for users with existing `.chronovyan` files
4. üìù Fix remaining cross-reference issues in documentation index files

## Validation Steps

The following validation steps have been completed:

1. ‚úÖ Verified that the Chronovyan interpreter now accepts `.cvy` files
2. ‚úÖ Confirmed all documentation references the new extension
3. ‚úÖ Created example files with the new extension for testing
4. ‚úÖ Updated help text to reflect the new extensions
5. ‚úÖ Added warnings for files using the old extension format
6. ‚úÖ Ran cross-reference validation to ensure file paths are correct

## Example Programs

As part of the file extension change, we've created several example programs:

1. A basic "Hello World" program demonstrating the simplest Chronovyan application
2. A temporal branching example demonstrating how to create and manage timeline branches

## Conclusion

The migration from `.chronovyan` to `.cvy` file extensions has been successfully completed. The new extension is shorter, more user-friendly, and properly documented throughout the codebase. This change aligns with the roadmap goals in Phase 3 of the Chronovyan development plan.
