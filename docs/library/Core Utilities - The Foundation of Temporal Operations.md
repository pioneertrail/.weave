# Core Utilities: The Foundation of Temporal Operations

## Introduction
The Chronovyan Standard Library provides a comprehensive set of core utilities that form the foundation of temporal operations. These utilities enable developers to perform common tasks efficiently while maintaining timeline stability and resource management.

## Core Operations

### 1. Timeline Management
```chronovyan
// Timeline creation and manipulation
timeline_ops {
    create: {
        stability: high;
        resources: {
            aethel: 10;
            chronon: 5;
        }
    }
    merge: {
        stability: medium;
        resources: {
            aethel: 5;
            chronon: 3;
        }
    }
    split: {
        stability: low;
        resources: {
            aethel: 8;
            chronon: 4;
        }
    }
}

// Timeline utilities
timeline_utils {
    stabilize: {
        method: automatic;
        priority: high;
    }
    validate: {
        checks: [stability, consistency, causality];
        threshold: 0.8;
    }
    optimize: {
        strategy: balanced;
        focus: [resources, stability, performance];
    }
}
```

### 2. Resource Operations
```chronovyan
// Resource management utilities
resource_ops {
    allocate: {
        aethel: {
            amount: 100;
            priority: high;
        }
        chronon: {
            amount: 50;
            priority: medium;
        }
    }
    deallocate: {
        method: graceful;
        cleanup: true;
    }
    optimize: {
        strategy: efficient;
        target: [aethel, chronon];
    }
}

// Resource monitoring
resource_utils {
    track: {
        metrics: [usage, efficiency, waste];
        interval: real_time;
    }
    predict: {
        horizon: 10;
        accuracy: high;
    }
    alert: {
        thresholds: {
            critical: 0.1;
            warning: 0.3;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. State Management
```chronovyan
// State operations
state_ops {
    save: {
        method: atomic;
        consistency: guaranteed;
    }
    restore: {
        method: safe;
        validation: true;
    }
    sync: {
        method: automatic;
        conflict_resolution: smart;
    }
}

// State utilities
state_utils {
    validate: {
        checks: [consistency, integrity, causality];
        strictness: high;
    }
    optimize: {
        strategy: balanced;
        focus: [memory, performance, stability];
    }
    monitor: {
        metrics: [changes, conflicts, stability];
        interval: continuous;
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Use appropriate allocation strategies
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Implement proper cleanup

2. **State Management**
   - Ensure atomic operations
   - Maintain consistency
   - Handle conflicts gracefully

3. **Timeline Operations**
   - Validate before operations
   - Monitor stability
   - Optimize when possible

## Examples

timeline_ops.create {
    stability: high;
    resources: {
        aethel: 10;
        chronon: 5;
    }
}

// Merge timelines
timeline_ops.merge {
    stability: medium;
    validation: true;
}
```

### Resource Management

// Allocate resources
resource_ops.allocate {
    aethel: {
        amount: 100;
        priority: high;
    }
    chronon: {
        amount: 50;
        priority: medium;
    }
}

// Monitor resources
resource_utils.track {
    metrics: [usage, efficiency];
    interval: real_time;
}
```

### State Operations
```chronovyan
// Save state
state_ops.save {
    method: atomic;
    consistency: guaranteed;
}

// Restore state
