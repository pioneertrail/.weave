# Chronovyan Technical Debt Tracking

This document tracks technical debt in the Chronovyan project, providing a centralized location to identify, prioritize, and monitor issues that should be addressed in future development cycles.

## What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt represents shortcuts, workarounds, or imperfect solutions that were implemented to meet immediate needs but should be revisited to ensure long-term code quality and maintainability.

## Tracking Format

Technical debt items in the codebase should be marked with comments in the following format:

```cpp
// TODO(TECH-DEBT): [Brief description] - [Expected impact] - [Target date/milestone]
```

For example:
```cpp
// TODO(TECH-DEBT): Refactor error handling logic to use polymorphic error types - Improves maintainability - v2.0
```

## Current Technical Debt Items

### High Priority (Address before next release)

| ID | Description | Location | Impact | Target |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| TD-1 | Complex error handling in StateController | src/state_controller.cpp | Difficult to extend error cases | v1.2 |
| TD-2 | Duplicate logic for sensor recovery in ModeDecisionEngine | src/mode_decision_engine.cpp | Increases chance of bugs when adding new recovery paths | v1.2 |

### Medium Priority (Address within next 2 releases)

| ID | Description | Location | Impact | Target |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| TD-3 | Lack of centralized logging strategy | Multiple files | Inconsistent debug output | v1.3 |
| TD-4 | Test-specific handling scattered throughout production code | src/mode_decision_engine.cpp, src/state_controller.cpp | Makes test maintenance difficult | v1.3 |

### Low Priority (Address when convenient)

| ID | Description | Location | Impact | Target |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| TD-5 | Magic numbers for thresholds in ModeDecisionEngine | src/mode_decision_engine.cpp | Reduced configurability | v1.4 |
| TD-6 | String-based reason codes instead of enum values | Multiple files | Error-prone string comparison | v1.4 |

## Technical Debt Management Process

1. **Identification**: Mark technical debt in code as it's created and add it to this document
2. **Prioritization**: Review and prioritize debt items during sprint planning
3. **Tracking**: Update this document when items are addressed or reprioritized
4. **Review**: Conduct periodic technical debt reviews to ensure nothing is missed

## Recently Addressed Technical Debt

| ID | Description | Resolution | Version |
|----|-------------|------------|---------|
| TD-A1 | String matching conflicts between test cases | Implemented more precise matching | v1.1 |
| TD-A2 | Inconsistent handling of cooldown periods | Standardized bypass mechanism | v1.1 |
| TD-A3 | Debug output scattered throughout code | Added conditional compilation | v1.1 |

## Metrics and Monitoring

We will track the following metrics related to technical debt:

1. Total number of technical debt items
2. Ratio of high/medium/low priority items
3. Average age of technical debt items
4. Technical debt addressed per release

## Next Review Date

The next technical debt review is scheduled for: [DATE OF NEXT SPRINT PLANNING]
