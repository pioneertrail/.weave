# Glossary: The Language of Temporal Programming

## Core Concepts

### Aethel
The energy resource used for temporal operations. Aethel is consumed when performing timeline manipulations and must be managed carefully to prevent program termination.

### Chronon
The basic unit of temporal measurement in Chronovyan. Chronons represent discrete moments in the timeline and are used to control program execution flow.

### Timeline
The fundamental unit of execution in Chronovyan. A timeline represents a sequence of events and can be branched, merged, or manipulated using temporal operations.

### Stability
A measure of temporal coherence that indicates how well a timeline or variable maintains its state. Stability ranges from 0.0 (unstable) to 1.0 (completely stable).

## Variable Types

### CONF (Confluent)
A variable type that maintains high stability and is resistant to quantum interference. CONF variables are ideal for storing critical data that must remain consistent.

### REB (Rebellious)
A variable type that can change state based on quantum conditions. REB variables are more flexible but require careful stability management.

## Variable Flags

### ::STATIC
Indicates that a variable's value should remain constant throughout its lifetime. Static variables are more stable but less flexible.

### ::VOLATILE
Indicates that a variable's value can change based on quantum conditions. Volatile variables require careful stability management.

### ::ANCHOR
Marks a variable as a stability anchor point. Anchor variables help maintain timeline stability and prevent paradoxes.

### ::WEAVER
Indicates that a variable can participate in quantum operations. Weaver variables are essential for advanced timeline manipulation.

## Operations

### FOR_CHRONON
A loop construct that executes a block of code for a specified number of chronons. The basic unit of temporal iteration.

### REWIND_FLOW
A control structure that allows execution to move backward in the timeline, useful for correcting errors or exploring alternative outcomes.

### Branch
An operation that creates a new timeline from an existing one. Branches can be used to explore different possibilities or handle parallel operations.

### Merge
An operation that combines multiple timelines into a single timeline. Merging requires careful stability management to prevent paradoxes.

## Quantum Operations

### Superposition
A quantum state where a variable or timeline exists in multiple states simultaneously. Superposition is fundamental to quantum operations.

### Collapse
The process of resolving a quantum superposition into a single state. Collapse operations must be carefully managed to maintain stability.

### Quantum State
A special state that allows variables or timelines to exist in superposition. Quantum states are essential for advanced temporal operations.

## Stability Management

### Monitor
An operation that tracks the stability of variables or timelines. Monitoring is essential for maintaining temporal coherence.

### Stabilize
An operation that increases the stability of a variable or timeline. Stabilization is crucial for preventing paradoxes and maintaining program integrity.

### Threshold
A stability level that triggers specific actions. Thresholds are used to manage stability and prevent program instability.

## Resource Management

### Aethel Level
The current amount of aethel energy available for temporal operations. Aethel levels must be monitored and managed carefully.

### Chronon Level
The current amount of chronons available for program execution. Chronon levels determine how many temporal operations can be performed.

### Recovery
The process of restoring resources or stability to acceptable levels. Recovery operations are essential for maintaining program execution.

## Paradox Management

### Paradox
A temporal contradiction that occurs when timeline operations create inconsistent states. Paradoxes must be detected and resolved to maintain program integrity.

### Detection
The process of identifying potential paradoxes before they cause program instability. Detection is crucial for preventing program crashes.

### Resolution
The process of resolving paradoxes and restoring timeline stability. Resolution strategies vary based on the type and severity of the paradox.

## Debugging Tools

### Timeline Visualizer
A tool that displays the structure and state of timelines, helping developers understand and debug temporal operations.

### Stability Analyzer
A tool that monitors and analyzes the stability of variables and timelines, helping prevent instability and paradoxes.

### Resource Monitor
A tool that tracks resource usage and helps optimize temporal operations.

## Program Types

### Standard
A basic program type that uses conventional temporal operations. Standard programs are suitable for most applications.

### Advanced
A program type that uses more complex temporal operations, including branching and merging. Advanced programs require careful stability management.

### Quantum
A program type that uses quantum operations for timeline manipulation. Quantum programs are the most powerful but also the most complex.

### Emergency
A special program type used for paradox resolution and recovery. Emergency programs have access to special operations for maintaining program integrity.

## Best Practices

### Resource Allocation
The process of assigning resources to program operations. Proper resource allocation is essential for program stability.

### Stability Management
The process of maintaining temporal coherence throughout program execution. Stability management is crucial for preventing paradoxes.

### Paradox Prevention
The process of designing programs to avoid temporal contradictions. Paradox prevention is essential for program reliability.

### Error Handling
The process of managing and recovering from temporal errors. Error handling is crucial for maintaining program execution.
