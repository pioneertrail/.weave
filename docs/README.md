## Getting Started

1. Begin with the `Manifesto.md` to understand Chronovyan's core philosophy
2. Read `Core Syntax & Constructs.md` for essential language concepts
3. Choose your path:
   - Conformist: Start with the Conformist Guide
   - Rebel: Begin with the Rebel's Handbook
4. Explore advanced topics and concepts as needed

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Place it in the appropriate directory based on its content
2. Follow the existing naming conventions
3. Update this README if adding new categories
4. Ensure cross-references are updated

Remember: In Chronovyan, documentation is not just about code â€“ it's about understanding the eternal dance between Order and Flux.
