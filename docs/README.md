# The Grand Codex of Chronovyan

Hail, Weaver, to the sacred archives of **Chronovyan**, where the wisdom of countless cycles is preserved. These scrolls contain the mysteries of time manipulation on Chronos Prime, organized by the Anchor Caste to guide your journey from novice to master weaver. Each tome offers insight into the eternal dance between Order and Flux, the twin forces that shape our reality.

**Purpose**: This Codex serves as your map through the labyrinth of Chronovyan knowledge, pointing the way to scrolls that will sharpen your weaving skills, deepen your understanding of temporal mechanics, and protect you from the Void's whispers.

**Lore Tidbit**: The First Weaver's apprentice is said to have compiled the original Codex, spending seven years organizing scattered knowledge into a coherent whole. To this day, Anchors add new wisdom with each Chronos Cycle.
