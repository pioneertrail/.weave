**Purpose**: This Codex serves as your map through the labyrinth of Chronovyan knowledge, pointing the way to scrolls that will sharpen your weaving skills, deepen your understanding of temporal mechanics, and protect you from the Void's whispers.

**Lore Tidbit**: The First Weaver's apprentice is said to have compiled the original Codex, spending seven years organizing scattered knowledge into a coherent whole. To this day, Anchors add new wisdom with each Chronos Cycle.

## The Initiation Path

1. Begin with the `Manifesto.md` to understand the sacred purpose of our craft
2. Study `Core Syntax & Constructs.md` to learn the basic glyphs of time-weaving
3. Choose your caste path:
   - Conformist: Follow the disciplined way of the Anchor
   - Rebel: Embrace the daring spirit of the Seeker
4. Explore advanced scrolls as your mastery grows

## Contributing to the Codex

When adding new wisdom to our archives:
1. Place your scroll in the appropriate chamber based on its nature
2. Follow the naming rites of the existing tomes
3. Update this guide if creating a new category of knowledge
4. Ensure all references to other scrolls remain intact

**Lore Tidbit**: Each contribution to the Codex is said to strengthen the Prime Thread, binding all Weavers across time into a unified tapestry of knowledge. Your words may echo for generations, guiding those who come after.
