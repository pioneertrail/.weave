# Chronovyan Language Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 (In Progress) - Foundation & Philosophy

### Completed:
- Initial Manifesto structure with core philosophy
- Documentation of the duality between Order and Flux
- Basic exploration of Conformist and Rebel paths
- Initial documentation structure and organization

### In Progress:
- Refining the philosophical underpinnings

## Phase 6: Community & Ecosystem

### 6.1 Development Tools
- [ ] Design IDE integration
- [ ] Implement package manager
- [ ] Create build system
- [ ] Develop testing framework

### 6.2 Community Building
- [ ] Establish contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create community resources
- [ ] Develop governance model
- [ ] Build communication channels

### 6.3 Future Directions
- [ ] Research advanced features

## Notes

- This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as we develop Chronovyan
- Phases may overlap and can be worked on in parallel
- Priority will be given to core features that demonstrate the language's unique philosophy
- Each phase should maintain the balance between Conformist and Rebel approaches

Remember: In Chronovyan, development is not just about building a language â€“ it's about weaving a new reality in code.
