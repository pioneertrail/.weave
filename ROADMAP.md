# Chronovyan Language Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 (In Progress) - Foundation & Philosophy

### Completed:
- Initial Manifesto structure with core philosophy
- Documentation of the duality between Order and Flux
- Basic exploration of Conformist and Rebel paths
- Initial documentation structure and organization

### In Progress:
- Refining the philosophical underpinnings
- Expanding the Manifesto with detailed sections
- Developing the narrative of programming as temporal weaving

## Phase 2: Core Language Design & Specification

### 2.1 Formal Language Specification
- [ ] **Formal Grammar (BNF/EBNF)**: Write a complete, precise description of Chronovyan's syntax
- [ ] **Semantics Document**: Define exactly how each construct behaves at runtime
- [ ] **Standard Library Design**: List essential built-in functions, types, and modules
- [ ] Collect and formalize all Chronovyan syntax from documentation and examples
- [ ] Write a "language specification" document: keywords, grammar, variable declarations, loops, temporal commands, and data types
- [ ] For each construct, specify its runtime behavior (e.g., how does `REWIND_FLOW` manipulate state?)
- [ ] Decide on standard data types and temporal resource models (Chronons, Aethel, etc)

### 2.2 Variable System
- [ ] Define CONF and REB variable types
- [ ] Implement variable flags (::STATIC, ::VOLATILE, ::ANCHOR, ::WEAVER)
- [ ] Design temporal variable properties
- [ ] Create variable interaction rules

### 2.3 Loop Mechanics
- [ ] Design standard loop constructs (FOR_CHRONON, WHILE_EVENT)
- [ ] Implement rebel loops (REWIND_FLOW, TEMPORAL_ECHO_LOOP)
- [ ] Define loop control mechanisms
- [ ] Create loop stability metrics

### 2.4 Resource System
- [ ] Define Chronon allocation and consumption
- [ ] Design Aethel generation and spending
- [ ] Implement temporal debt mechanics
- [ ] Create resource monitoring tools

## Phase 3: Reference Implementation

### 3.1 Interpreter Architecture
- [ ] **Choose Implementation Language**: Select a host language for the interpreter (Python, C++, Rust, etc.)
- [ ] **Design the Interpreter Structure**:
  - **Lexer**: Converts Chronovyan code into tokens
  - **Parser**: Turns tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
  - **Evaluator/Executor**: Walks the AST to execute Chronovyan code
- [ ] **Build AST Node Classes**: Define classes for each Chronovyan construct

### 3.2 Core Interpreter Implementation
- [ ] **Implement the Lexer**: Recognize keywords, identifiers, symbols, literals, and comments
- [ ] **Implement the Parser**: Parse variable declarations, assignments, expressions, and control structures
- [ ] **Implement the Evaluator**: Start with variable storage and simple arithmetic, add execution for loops and conditionals
- [ ] **Resource Tracking**: Implement temporal resource tracking (Chronons, Aethel)
- [ ] **Temporal Commands**: Add support for temporal commands with defined effects

### 3.3 Advanced Features
- [ ] **Loot System**: Design loot types and properties, implement discovery mechanics
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Design temporal paradox detection, implement glitch handling
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Track and enforce resource consumption, handle temporal debt
- [ ] **Custom Types**: Support for arrays, functions, modules, etc.

## Notes

- This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as we develop Chronovyan
- Phases may overlap and can be worked on in parallel
- Priority will be given to core features that demonstrate the language's unique philosophy
- Each phase should maintain the balance between Conformist and Rebel approaches

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the formal grammar and semantics document**
2. **Build a minimal prototype interpreter**
3. **Create example programs to test concepts**
4. **Gather feedback and refine the design**

Remember: In Chronovyan, development is not just about building a language â€“ it's about weaving a new reality in code.
