Fantastic job on debugging and fixing the test!

Let's continue our focus on the next test.

Please:
1.  **Analyze the Test :
    
2.  **Review Exception Handling in Code**:
    

3.  **Hypothesize and Propose Fix**:
    

4.  **Implement and Verify**:
    * Implement your proposed fix.
    * Provide the build command:
        ```bash
        cd ./build; cmake --build . --target
    
    * If the test passes, run the group of recently fixed tests suite to check for regressions:
        ```bash
        cd ./build; ./(tests_file).exe --gtest_filter=*
        ```
